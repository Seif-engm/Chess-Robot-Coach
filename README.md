# Chess Coach Robot

## Project Overview

The **Chess Coach Robot** is an AI-powered assistant designed to help users play chess by using **computer vision** and **voice recognition**. It captures the chessboard’s state in real-time using a camera and suggests optimal moves based on the current position. The robot also understands voice commands to allow users to interact with it seamlessly, making it an interactive and accessible way to improve at chess.

**Objective**:  
To build a chess-playing assistant robot that:
- Recognizes and tracks chessboard positions through computer vision.
- Analyzes the game and suggests moves using the Stockfish chess engine.
- Provides voice feedback to the user about the game state and player moves.
- Listens to voice commands to allow the user to control the game hands-free.
