# Chess Coach Robot

## Project Overview

The **Chess Coach Robot** is an AI-powered assistant designed to help users play chess by using **computer vision** and **voice recognition**. It captures the chessboard’s state in real-time using a camera and suggests optimal moves based on the current position. The robot also understands voice commands to allow users to interact with it seamlessly, making it an interactive and accessible way to improve at chess.

**Objective**:  
To build a chess-playing assistant robot that:
- Recognizes and tracks chessboard positions through computer vision.
- Analyzes the game and suggests moves using the Stockfish chess engine.
- Provides voice feedback to the user about the game state and player moves.
- Listens to voice commands to allow the user to control the game hands-free.

## Features

### Phase I. ** Chess-Robot-Construction(Energy-System)**

Thanks to natural resources, innovative methods have been invented to produce and generate energy. The project is based on 3 main methods: solar energy using the sunflower method, hydraulic energy by coupling a turbine and a water recycling system, and osmotic energy to generate electricity.This code emulates some sensors and actuators parts needed for the functionality of our energy system. 


### Phase II. **Human-Machine-Systems(Chess Logic)**
**Computer Vision Integration**:
- Uses a camera to capture real-time images of the chessboard.
- Processes images with machine learning models to detect and recognize chess pieces and their positions on the board.
- Tracks and updates the board state after each move.
**Interactive Gameplay**:
- Supports two-way interaction: the player speaks to the robot to make moves, and the robot responds with its move suggestions or explanations.
- Provides move validation and confirmation with voice feedback.


### Phase III. **Student-Learning-Outcomes(Voice Recognition)**:
- Listens for player voice commands to make moves and perform other actions.
- Provides voice feedback such as move confirmations and game status updates.
- Uses Google’s Text-to-Speech (gTTS) and SpeechRecognition libraries for speech synthesis and recognition.
