Chess Coach Robot
Project Overview
The Chess Coach Robot is designed to assist players by using advanced computer vision and voice recognition technologies. It can analyze and recognize chessboard states and moves, helping users by providing move suggestions and analyzing positions. The robot interacts with the player using voice commands, enabling a hands-free and intuitive user experience.

Objective:
To build a chess-playing assistant robot that:

Recognizes chessboard positions through computer vision.
Analyzes the game and suggests moves.
Provides voice feedback on the game status, moves, and suggestions.
What Youâ€™ll Need:

A camera for capturing the chessboard.
A microphone for voice interaction.
A Python environment with specific libraries for computer vision, deep learning, and voice recognition.
Key Features
Computer Vision for Chessboard Recognition:
Detects chess pieces on the board and tracks their movements in real-time.

Voice Interaction:
Provides feedback and allows players to make moves using voice commands.

Game Analysis:
Analyzes positions and suggests optimal moves for the player.

Real-time Updates:
Continuously monitors the chessboard state and updates game status.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to get your Chess Coach Robot running and start playing chess with a virtual coach!

Materials
Camera: To capture images of the chessboard for computer vision processing.
Microphone: For voice recognition and interaction.
Computer: A device capable of running Python and the necessary libraries.
Prerequisites
Before diving into the setup, make sure you have the required hardware components mentioned above and software dependencies installed.

Software Dependencies
